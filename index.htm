    INFORMATION 
    <p>

International trade is the exchange of goods,
 services, and capital across national borders, and it plays a vital
  role in shaping the global economy. <br> allows countries to 
  specialize in the production of goods and services that they can create most 
  efficiently, while importing items that are produced more effectively elsewhere.
   This system of comparative advantage increases overall productivity, lowers costs 
   for consumers, and provides a wider variety of products in the global market. <br>
   For example, a country with fertile land and favorable climate may export 
   agricultural products, while another with advanced technology may export machinery or software. <br>Beyond the movement of goods, 
   international trade fosters cultural exchange, strengthens diplomatic ties, and encourages innovation by exposing businesses to global
    competition. However, it also presents challenges such as trade imbalances, protectionist policies, dependency on foreign markets, and 
    the risk of economic disruption from global crises like pandemics or conflicts. <br>Organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO)
     and regional trade agreements like the European Union or ASEAN play important roles in regulating, facilitating, and promoting fair trade
      practices. <br>Overall, international trade remains a key driver of economic growth and globalization, linking nations together through a 
      complex web of interdependence that affects nearly every aspect of modern life.

<button class="p-botton">  <h1>THE DAY PIZZA MET PASTA </h1></button></br>
</p>
<p>
In a small coastal town in southern Italy, there was a little trattoria run by Nonna Rosa, a grandmother famous for two things:

Her wood-fired margherita pizza, with a crust so perfect it could make you cry.<br>



But Nonna Rosa had one rule carved in stone:

“Pizza is for the hands. Pasta is for the fork. Never mix them!”

One summer afternoon, a tourist from Canada walked into the trattoria. His Italian wasn’t great, but his hunger was 
massive. He looked at the menu, scratched his head, and said:



“Can I have… pizza with pasta on top?”


The whole restaurant froze. A fork clattered to the floor. Somewhere, an accordion stopped playing.

“Pizza… con pasta?!” Nonna Rosa repeated, clutching her heart.



But she was also a woman of curiosity. So, with a dramatic sigh, she decided to try. She made a thin, crispy pizza base, spread fresh
 tomato sauce, sprinkled mozzarella, then piled on steaming tagliatelle tossed with basil pesto. She served it to the Canadian with 
 a shake of her head, expecting disaster.<br>



The man took a bite… and his eyes lit up. The room waited.

“This,” he declared, “is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”



Within a week, locals were secretly ordering pizza con pasta. By the end of summer, it became the trattoria’s “off-menu special.” And though Nonna Rosa would still tell people:



“Tradition is important, but sometimes… rules are meant to be broken,”


…she kept a small note under her cash register that read.<br>

</p>
<body>
    <p>
In a small mountain town, there was a tea garden café run by an old woman named Aunty Reba. She wasn’t rich,
 but her cooking had magic in it—especially her pumpkin soup.<br>

One winter, a fierce snowstorm hit. Roads closed, markets emptied, and people were stuck in
 their homes without much to eat. But Aunty Reba? She had a habit of saving every pumpkin seed from the autumn harvest, drying them, 
 and planting more the next season. She also stored jars of her special spice mix—ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a secret pinch of
  something no one could guess.<br>

When the snow trapped the whole town, she opened her little café and began making giant 
pots of soup. People trudged through the snow just to have a bowl—hot steam fogging up the windows, the smell 
of roasted pumpkin wrapping around them like a blanket.<br>

No one paid in money that week. Instead, they brought whatever they had—apples, tea leaves, 
firewood, even a rabbit someone had found wandering in the cold (don’t worry, it became a pet, not dinner).<br>

When spring came, people still remembered that soup—not just for its taste, but because it
 reminded them that food isn’t only about feeding the body. It’s about warming the soul, bringing people
  together when the world feels cold.<br>
