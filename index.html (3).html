<br> corruption in Bangladesh over the past 15 years (2010–2025), emphasizing key scandals, trends, and recent developments:

Corruption Trends & Perception (2010–2025)</br>
• Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) shows Bangladesh scoring between 25 and 28 from 2012 to 2022, reflecting moderate but persistent concerns .<br>
• In 2023, the score dropped to 24; by 2024, it further declined to 23, marking the lowest rating since 2012 and ranking 151st out of 180 countries—one of the worst rankings in South Asia after Afghanistan . 
</br> <br>Major Corruption Scandals (2010–2025)

<br>1. Hallmark-Sonali Bank Loan Scam (2010–2012)</br>

A massive fraud at the state-owned Sonali Bank where over Tk 35 billion was illicitly loaned to Hallmark Group and affiliates. It’s often described as the country’s largest banking fraud in decades .

<br>2. Padma Bridge Graft Scandal (2016–2017)</br>

Allegations surfaced that SNC-Lavalin offered bribes to secure the bridge contract. 
The World Bank withdrew funding; however, the charges were later dismissed after key evidence was excluded .

<br>3. Barapukuria Coal Scam (2018)</br>

Roughly 150,000 tons of coal were found missing from the Barapukuria mine—worth over BDT 227 billion—triggering a 
high-profile investigation and suspensions of officials .

<br>4. Rooppur “Pillow” Scandal (2019)</br>

An outrage over excessive spending on project housing for Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant staff—satirically 
dubbed the “pillow scandal.” Thirteen people were arrested, though the matter remains under legal consideration .

<br>5. 2020 Election Commission Misconduct</br>

<br>Allegations of embezzlement, misuse of funds for false programs, fraud in staff recruitment, overpriced equipment, and misuse of assets led citizens and experts to demand a formal investigation into EC commissioners .

Recent High-Profile Investigations & Asset Exposés</br>
<br>• £400 million UK Property Empire: After Sheikh Hasina’s ousting, the interim government discovered that elites close to her had amassed around £400 million in UK real estate, prompting recovery efforts .
<br>• Asset Accumulation by Saifuzzaman Chowdhury: The former land minister is alleged to hold 482 properties 
worth $295 million across several countries. Investigators attribute large-scale embezzlement and aid to
 “crony lending” systems .</br>
<br>• FBI Money Laundering Findings: The US FBI discovered that Sajeeb Wazed, Sheikh Hasina’s son,
 owned luxury vehicles and engaged in laundering funds (~$300 million) to the US and UK. An ACC probe is ongoing .</br>
<br>• Tulip Siddiq (UK MP) Trial: Hasina’s niece, Tulip Siddiq, faces corruption charges tied to
 plotting improper land acquisition or embezzlement linked to a nuclear deal. She denies wrongdoing,
  calling the case politically driven. She recently resigned from her UK ministerial role and is being further 
  scrutinized over alleged UK assets and dual citizenship .</br>

<br>Period Highlights</br>
<br>2010–2019 Hallmark loan scam, Padma Bridge, Barapukuria coal, Rooppur scandal</br>
<br>2020–2022 EC corruption allegations, CPI decline trend begins</br>
<br>2023–2025 Lowest CPI score since 2012, asset investigations of Hasina-era figures</br>

<br>Takeaways</br>
<br>• Despite some institutional rhetoric against corruption, CPI performance shows a downward trend, indicating growing systemic weaknesses.
<br>• Scandals span banking, infrastructure, energy, election oversight, and real estate.</br>
<br>• Recent probes by the interim government illustrate intensified efforts to reclaim assets and hold powerful </br>
figures accountable</br>
